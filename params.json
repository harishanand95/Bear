{"name":"Bear","tagline":"A Cortana or Siri like application (personal assistant) for Gnome 3 that displays notifications as cards.","body":"### Welcome to Bear Project\r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a Cortana like application for Gnome 3 systems. The replies from Bear will be shown as cards in the material design. The following are the development phases (++ completed,-- not completed).\r\n\r\n- ++ Card interface for displaying notification\r\n- ++ Api.ai, an online artificial intelligent agent's API calls\r\n- ++ Voice Recognition engine defaults to Api.ai\r\n- ++ Added Node.js based Google Speech API to enhance speech recognition accuracy\r\n- ++ Created command line interface to call Bear\r\n- -- Display of pictures in Card interface\r\n- -- Creation of a text field to type and search.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n   \r\n1. Run the command \"python setup.py \" on the extracted folder.\r\n2. In Settings -> About, Get the Shell number.\r\n3. Add/Replace the shell number to the Projectbear@email.com/metadata.json file.\r\n4. Enable Bear in extension tab of Gnome Tweak Tool.\r\n\r\n### Google Speech API \r\nTurn ON Google Speech API, you need an API key from Google. You can obtain the key by following the steps in this [Google API link](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys).\r\n\r\nOnce you have obtained the key, few changes are needed. \r\n  1. In Bear python file,  change\r\n           `using_google_speech_api = False`  to  `using_google_speech_api = True`\r\n\r\n  2. In the .Bear/index.js file, add the api key value instead of GOOGLE SPEECH API KEY\r\n           `key: 'GOOGLE SPEECH API KEY'`  to like   `key: 'qwerty1234567890asdf'`\r\n\r\n### How to run Bear\r\n\r\n![speech](https://maxcdn.icons8.com/windows8/PNG/32/Security/voice_recognition_scan-32.png) \r\nSpeak to Bear after clicking speech icon ![wave](https://maxcdn.icons8.com/iOS7/PNG/25/Music/audio_wave-25.png) at the main panel .\r\n\r\nSay , \r\n\r\n             \" What is Google?\" or \" Who is Bill Gates?\"\r\n\r\nIt records the audio for 10 seconds and sents it for processing to Api.ai speech recognition engine.\r\nIf Google Speech API is enabled, then audio file is sent to Google Speech engine. \r\nAfter obtaining the audio text, it is sent for processing at Api.ai and results are displayed as card notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso in terminal, type \r\n\r\n                       \"Bear What is Google?\"\r\n                       \"Bear Who is Bill Gates?\"\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Bear?
