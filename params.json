{"name":"Bear","tagline":"A Cortana or Siri like application (personal assistant) for Gnome 3 that displays notifications as cards.","body":"### Welcome to Bear Project\r\n\r\nThis project is currently in development phase. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a Cortana like application for Gnome 3 systems. The replies from Bear will be shown as cards in the material design. The following are the development phases (++ completed,-- not completed).\r\n\r\n- ++ Card interface for displaying notification\r\n- ++ Api.ai, an online artificial intelligent agent's API calls\r\n- ++ Voice Recognition engine defaults to Api.ai\r\n- ++ Added Node.js based Google Speech API to enhance speech recognition accuracy\r\n- ++ Created command line interface to call Bear\r\n- -- Display of pictures in Card interface\r\n- -- Creation of a text field to type and search.\r\n- -- Error detection mechanism ( Currently developing).\r\n\r\nThe project has only been tested in Fedora systems.\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n####Main Panel Notification\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5oc0s91gobs42nw/Screenshot%20from%202016-01-24%2000-39-13.png)\r\n\r\n####Card pop-up Notification\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/z41d650j8i6ln03/Screenshot%20from%202016-01-24%2000-42-22.png)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n   \r\n1. Run the command \"python setup.py \" on the extracted folder.\r\n2. In Settings -> Details , Get the GNOME Version number.\r\n3. Add/Replace the shell number to the Projectbear@email.com/metadata.json file.\r\n4. Enable Bear in extension tab of Gnome Tweak Tool application.\r\n5. Use Alt + F2 and type r to restart GNOME.\r\n6. Please make sure that there is microphone in your system and is not MUTED.\r\n\r\n### Google Speech API \r\nTo have a highly accurate prediction of voice (even during noise), use GOOGLE SPEECH API.\r\nTo use Google Speech API, you need an API key from Google. You can obtain the key by following the steps in this [Google API link](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys).\r\n\r\nOnce you have obtained the key, few changes are needed. \r\n  1. In Bear python file,  change\r\n           `using_google_speech_api = False`  to  `using_google_speech_api = True`\r\n\r\n  2. In the .Bear/index.js file, add the api key value instead of GOOGLE SPEECH API KEY\r\n           `key: 'GOOGLE SPEECH API KEY'`  to like   `key: 'qwerty1234567890asdf'`\r\n\r\n### How to run Bear\r\n\r\n![speech](https://maxcdn.icons8.com/windows8/PNG/32/Security/voice_recognition_scan-32.png) \r\nSpeak to Bear after clicking speech icon ![wave](https://maxcdn.icons8.com/iOS7/PNG/25/Music/audio_wave-25.png) at the main panel .\r\n\r\nSay , \r\n\r\n             \" What is Google?\" or \" Who is Bill Gates?\" or \"how are you\"\r\n\r\n   to talk to Bear/api.ai engine.\r\nIt records the audio for 10 seconds and sents it for processing to Api.ai speech recognition engine.\r\nIf Google Speech API is enabled, then audio file is sent to Google Speech engine. \r\nAfter obtaining the audio text, it is sent for processing at Api.ai and results are displayed as card notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso in terminal, you can call Bear command by giving \r\n\r\n                       \"Bear What is Google?\"\r\n                       \"Bear Who is Bill Gates?\"\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Bear?
